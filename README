This package is running with the NEURON simulation program written by Michael
Hines and available on internet at:
  http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/
  http://neuron.duke.edu/

The package contains mechanisms (.mod files) and programs (.oc files) needed
to simulate networks of thalamic reticular (RE) neurons interacting with
inhibitory synapses.  The approach followed here uses the object-oriented
facilities of NEURON to simulate networks, and can be applied to other types
of neurons and/or other types of synaptic interactions.  

This model studies the genesis of 10Hz oscillations by inhibitory networks of
RE neurons in the thalamus.  Each neuron is described by a single-compartment
containing voltage- and calcium-dependent currents described by Hodgkin-Huxley
type of model.  Synaptic interactions are handled by kinetic models of
postsynaptic receptors of the GABA_A and GABA_B types.  

The models given here are described in detail in the following paper:

  MECHANISMS
  ==========

HH2.mod         : Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics for action potentials
IT2.mod         : low-threshold calcium current of thalamic RE neurons
IAHP.mod        : calcium-activated K+ current responsible for AHP
ICAN.mod        : calcium-activated nonspecific cation current
capump.mod      : calcium clearance mechanisms

gaba.mod        : two-state kinetic model for GABA_A receptors
gabab1.mod      : two-state kinetic model for GABA_B receptors


  HOW TO RUN
  ==========

Use autolaunch on modeldb or:

unix platform:

  To compile the demo, NEURON and INTERVIEWS must be installed and working on
  the machine you are using.  Just type "nrnivmodl" to compile the mechanisms
  given in the mod files.

  Then, execute the main demo program by typing:

  nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin platform:

  Compile the mechanism (mod) files by using mknrndll.  Then start the simulation
  by clicking on mosinit.hoc in windows explorer.

back to any platform:

Once the menu and graphics interface has appeared, click on a simulation from
the Simulations of thalamic reticular network window.  Reposition the windows
to find the Run Control window.  Then click on "Init and Run" button to start
the simulation on the RunControl window.

7/11/2005 this model updated to close windows and reopen a run control
window between simulations.

ModelDB-Note: This model updated for NEURON version 4.3.1 and higher.

10-2007: AD, better synaptic mechanisms using counters
20120106 changed mod files for better solve methods (avoid euler)
as per web page http://www.neuron.yale.edu/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=592
2024-11: Updated hoc files to use Random123
